# Blender2MSFS2
Collaborative adoption of Blender2MSFS which apparently has been left in limbo by its author

The releases of the upstream Blender2MSFS are archived at
https://www.fsdeveloper.com/forum/resources/blender2msfs-toolkit.256/history
. As can be seen, there has been no public releases since
September 2020. That is hardly ideal.

The intent of this repository is to enable people to co-operate on
further work on this exporter.

I am not personally adopting this code, and/or volunteering to
maintain it, as I don't have the skills needed. I am not a Python
expert at all. I don't know Blender's data structures (as accessible
from Python). I don't really know glTF at all. And finally, I have
been using Blender for only two months.

My role is just to set up this repository and import the Blender2MSFS
releases into it. I will gladly give away maintainership of this repo
(however that would be done) if some interested and eager volunteer
appears.

If the original author re-appears and starts releasing newer versions,
this repository might well become obsolete.

The original README is MSFSToolkit/readme.md

There are also other efforts on export from Blender to MSFS, and even import of MSFS 3D assets to Blender.

The most promising is perhaps
https://github.com/flybywiresim/msfs2blender2msfs , which is forked
from the official Khronos glTF 2.0 importer and exporter. Sadly, that
too apparently has stagnated somewhat.

For import from MSFS to Blender, there is
