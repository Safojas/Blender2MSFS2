# Blender2MSFS2
Collaborative adoption of Blender2MSFS which apparently has been left in limbo by its author

The releases of the upstream Blender2MSFS are archived at https://www.fsdeveloper.com/forum/resources/blender2msfs-toolkit.256/history . As can be seen, there has been no public releases since September 2020. That is hardly ideal.

The intent of this repository is to enable people to co-operate on further work on it.

If the original author re-appears and starts releasing newer versions, this repository might well become obsolete.

There are also other efforts on export from Blender to MSFS, and even import of MSFS 3D assets to Blender.

The most promising is perhaps https://github.com/flybywiresim/msfs2blender2msfs , which is forked from the official Khronos glTF 2.0 importer and exporter. Sadly, that too apparently is stagnating.

For import from MSFS to Blender, there is https://github.com/bestdani/msfs2blend
